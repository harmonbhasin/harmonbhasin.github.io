# About

I completed my undergrad in CS from UW-Madison, where I was privileged to be mentored by [Sushmita Roy](https://roylab.discovery.wisc.edu/), [Junjie Hu](https://junjiehu.github.io/), and [Stav Atir](https://www.stavatir.com/). During my time there, I developed methods for understanding gene regulation through analyzing single cell omic datasets (scRNA-seq & scATAC-seq), with orthogonal work in transformer interpretability. I had the pleasure of starting two startups and [one student organization](https://wiscobiosec.org/), all of which were cool learning experiences.
