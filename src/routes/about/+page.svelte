    I completed my undergrad in CS from UW-Madison, where I was privileged to be mentored by <a href="https://roylab.discovery.wisc.edu/" class="underline">Sushmita Roy</a>, <a href="https://junjiehu.github.io/" class="underline">Junjie Hu</a>, and <a href="https://www.stavatir.com/" class="underline">Stav Atir</a>. During my time there, I developed methods for understanding gene regulation through analyzing single cell omic datasets (scRNA-seq & scATAC-seq), with orthogonal work in transformer interpretability. I had the pleasure of starting two startups and <a href="https://wiscobiosec.org/" class="underline">one student organization</a>, all of which were cool learning experiences.
