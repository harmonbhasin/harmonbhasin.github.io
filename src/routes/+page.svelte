    <p>
        I am a Research Analyst I at SecureBio, where I work on the <a href="https://naobservatory.org/" class="underline">Nucleic Acid Observatory (NAO)</a> to advance global biosecurity. At the NAO, I develop and maintain <a href="https://github.com/naobservatory/mgs-workflow" class="underline">computational pipelines</a> for processing and analyzing large-scale (billions of read pairs) untargeted metagenomic sequencing data, with a focus on detecting emerging viral pathogens. I am also a research affiliate at MIT, working with <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/esvelt/overview/" class="underline">Kevin Esvelt</a> on blood-based biosurveillance systems. My research interests focus on <strong>computational biology</strong> and <strong>foundation models</strong>.

    <p>
        Currently, I'm most excited about these areas in omics research:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
        <li>Multi-modal/multi-omic data integration using foundation models</li>
        <li>Mechanistic interpretability of foundation models</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    
    <p>
    I completed my undergrad in CS from UW-Madison, where I was privileged to be mentored by <a href="https://roylab.discovery.wisc.edu/" class="underline">Sushmita Roy</a>, <a href="https://junjiehu.github.io/" class="underline">Junjie Hu</a>, and <a href="https://www.stavatir.com/" class="underline">Stav Atir</a>. During my time there, I developed methods for understanding gene regulation through analyzing single cell omic datasets (scRNA-seq & scATAC-seq), with orthogonal work in transformer interpretability. I had the pleasure of starting two startups and <a href="https://wiscobiosec.org/" class="underline">one student organization</a>, all of which were cool learning experiences.
    </p>

        <strong>If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to reach out</strong>. Having benefited from wonderful mentorship throughout my journey, I'm passionate about paying it forward. I'm particularly eager to support individuals from underrepresented communities who are interested in computational biology, biosecurity, or any of the areas mentioned above.
